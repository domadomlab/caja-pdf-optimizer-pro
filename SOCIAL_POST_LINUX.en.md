✅ **Goodbye, LibreOffice UI:** Convert `.docx` or `.odt` to PDF without ever opening the editor. Just hit "Optimize" and let the background magic happen.
✅ **Stealth Mode 🕵️:** Your PDF will look like a scan from a real HP or Canon printer. Metadata is faked on-the-fly, giving you perfect "alibi" and privacy.
